          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>My name is DeAndre Minor and I am a software engineer who is passionate about new technology, furthering education, and building strong relationships with people.
              In my previous career in education, I used universal skills such as planning, to set goals and plan lessons; communication to collaborate with peers, 
              and parents; time management to meet deadlines and finish timelines. I want to bring my abilities to plan, communicate and manage time in order to 
              progress further into software development. I want to help build something that can make people's lives easier, as well as contribute to aid in the worldâ€™s 
              education.
