            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey welcome to my page I'm glad that you stopped by! My name is DeAndre Minor and I am a software engineer. Recently I decided to start anew in the tech industry since I am very passionate about all the new technology that has come out and want to be a part of that world.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                Personally I really love to learning new things, and building strong relationships with people or animals dogs especially. In my previous career in education, I was greatful enough to learn and use universal skills such as <strong>planning</strong>, 
                to set goals and plan lessons, <strong>communication</strong> collaborate with peers, students and parents as well as <strong>time management</strong> to meet deadlines and finish timelines. I want to bring my abilities to plan, communicate and manage time in order to 
                progress further into software development.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I want to help build something that can make people's lives easier, as well as aid in the worldâ€™s 
                education. 
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
